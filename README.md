# Parallel-Algorithms-Assignment-Gauss-Jordan

<h2>Assignment</h2>
Describe and implement an MPI parallel algorithm of the Gauss-Jordan method (form kji) to solve a linear system of the form: Ax=b, where A nxn real nonsingular matrix and x,b n-dimensional vectors in a parallel computer with 
p &leq; n processors and by distributing the columns by groups:

- of k continuous columns
- with circular division (shuffling) of k columns
